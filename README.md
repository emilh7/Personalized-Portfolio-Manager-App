# Portfolio Management App

# Requirements

MySQL must be installed on your system and running.

The database be created either by running `CREATE DATABASE InvestmentDB;` or by running 'backend/makedb.sql'. The values for this database are made by running all the queries in 'backend/InvestmentDB.sql'.

If not already on your system, you will have to install multiple modules using pip and npm. They can be installed as follows,

Python/Django modules:

`pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers mysql mysqlclient mysql-connector-python`

ReactJS related modules (you may have to cd into the frontend-client directory for these to work):

`npm install -g expo-cli`

`cd frontend-client`

`npm install`

`npx expo install react-dom react-native-web @expo/metro-runtime`

Additionally, you will need some additional files in the 'api' and 'cpsc471project' directorys.

api/config.py:
```
config = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'YOUR SQL SERVER PASSWORD',
    'database': 'InvestmentDB'
}
```
(If your sql server username is something other than root, use that.)

cpsc471project/secretkey.py:
```
SQLPASS = 'YOUR SQL SERVER PASSWORD HERE'
```
***
# Running

From the base repository directory, run

`python manage.py runserver `

(if python doesn't work, try python3) 

In a separate terminal, from the base repository directory, run

`cd frontend-client`

`npx expo start --web`

After some time, the app should open as a new page in your web browser.
